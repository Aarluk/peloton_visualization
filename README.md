To keep learning about design and adding visual technology experience to my portfolio and experience, I am taking a 13-hour course on Data Visualization with D3.js from freecodecamp.org.

The goal is to create a webpage that showcases my partner's Peloton performance as a visual story, using the dataset from her Peloton account.
