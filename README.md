To keep learning about design and adding visual technology experience to my portfolio and experience, I am taking a 13-hour course on Data Visualization with D3.js from freecodecamp.org.

The goal is to create a webpage that showcases my partner's Peloton performance as a visual story, using the dataset from her Peloton account.

Data to represent:

* Workout timestamp
* Live/On demand class
* Instructor name
* Length of class in minutes
* Fitness Discipline
* Type (live dj or music, Power Zone...)
* Title of class
* class timestamp
* Total output
* Average watts
* Average resistance
* Average cadence (RPM)
* Average speed (mhp)
* Distance (miles)
* Calories burned
* Average heart rate

List of all the functions of D3:

Recommended by my bootcamp peer Jasmine: https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/index.html

WHAT SHE WANTS TO SEE:

* [X] With which professor do I have the best output per minute of work and which type of class

* [ ] What is my aggregate output by month

* [ ] How many classes have I taken with each professor and what types of classes.

* [ ] What are the total minutes I've worked out per week and month

* [ ] Which day of the week do I workout the hardest on average

* [ ] How many calories per month am I burning?
